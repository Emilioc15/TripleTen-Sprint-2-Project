# TripleTen-Sprint-2-Project
🛒 TripleTen Sprint 2: Instacart Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using a modified version of the Instacart grocery orders dataset. The goal is to clean the data, address missing and duplicate values, and uncover insights into customer shopping behavior.

The dataset was originally released by Instacart for a Kaggle competition and later adapted for this sprint to include data quality challenges while preserving the original distributions.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains information related to customer grocery orders, including:

Orders and reorder behavior

Product and aisle information

Customer shopping patterns over time

The data intentionally includes missing values and duplicates to simulate real-world analytical challenges.

🎯 Objectives

Load and explore the dataset structure

Identify and handle missing values and duplicates

Verify data consistency and distributions

Perform exploratory analysis to understand customer shopping habits

Create clear visualizations to communicate findings

Summarize insights using markdown explanations
